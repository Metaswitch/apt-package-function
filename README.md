# apt-package-function

Functionality to create a Debian package repository in Azure Blob Storage with
an Azure Function App to keep it up to date. For use with
[apt-transport-blob](https://github.com/microsoft/apt-transport-blob).

# Getting Started

## Required tools

- `poetry` and `poetry-plugin-export`: required for running the creation commands and exporting dependencies to requirements.txt format.
  - Poetry installation instructions are available at https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
  - Once poetry is installed, run
    ```bash
    poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
    ```
    to install `poetry-plugin-export`.
- Azure CLI
  - Installation instructions available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

- Docker (when not using shared key access from the function app to the storage container)
  - Installation instructions available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Basic usage

To create a new Debian package repository with an Azure Function App, run

```bash
poetry run create-resources <resource_group_name>
```

with the name of the desired resource group. The scripting will autogenerate a
package repository name for you - `debianrepo` followed by a unique string to
differentiate it across Azure.

If you wish to control the suffix used, you can pass the `--suffix` parameter:

```bash
poetry run create-resources --suffix <suffix> <resource_group_name>
```
which will attempt to create a storage container named `debianrepo<suffix>`.

By default all resources are created in the `eastus` location - this can be
overridden by passing the `--location` parameter:

```bash
poetry run create-resources --location uksouth <resource_group_name>
```

## No shared-key access / Managed Identities

By default, the storage container that is created has shared-key access enabled.
You can instead create a deployment that uses Managed Identities, but this
requires Docker (as the function application and its dependencies must be
compiled and packed appropriately).

To create a new Debian package repository which uses Managed Identities, run

```bash
poetry run create-resources --no-shared-key [--suffix <suffix>] [--location <location>] <resource_group_name>
```

This creates an additional blob container (`python`) in the storage account to
hold the compiled function application zip file; the function application is
run directly from that zip file.

# Design

The function app works as follows:

- It is triggered whenever a `.deb` file is uploaded to the monitored blob
  storage container
    - It is triggered by an Event Grid trigger.
- It iterates over all `.deb` files and looks for a matching `.package` file.
- If that file does not exist, it is created
    - The `.deb` file is downloaded and the control information is extracted
    - The hash values for the file are calculated (MD5sum, SHA1, SHA256)
    - All of this information is added to the `.package` file
- All `.package` files are iterated over, downloaded, and combined into a
  single `Package` file, which is then uploaded. A `Packages.xz` file is also
  created.

## Speed of repository update

The function app triggers at the speed of an Event Grid trigger running in Consumption
mode; in the worst case this means triggering from a Cold Start. In practice
the repository is updated within 1 minute.
